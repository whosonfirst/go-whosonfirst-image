# go-whosonfirst-image

Use `go-whosonfirst-svg` and `oksvg` to render Who's On First features as raster images. This doesn't work yet... I mean it runs but still produces bunk images.

## Install

You will need to have both `Go` (specifically a version of Go more recent than 1.7 so let's just assume you need [Go 1.9](https://golang.org/dl/) or higher) and the `make` programs installed on your computer. Assuming you do just type:

```
make bin
```

All of this package's dependencies are bundled with the code in the `vendor` directory.

## Important

Probably too soon. Best to move along.
